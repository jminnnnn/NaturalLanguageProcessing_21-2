1. Raw Data Pasrsing, Processing and Applying Regular Expressions: preprocessing practice on news data corpus from 국립국어원 (NIRW1900000011.json file is needed)

2. CrossEntropyLoss Calcuation for each n-gram: preprocessing and calucation of entropy&cross entropy for each n-gram created from 3 sources (NIRW1900000011.json, EBRW1908000138.json, NWRW1800000045.json are needed)

3. KoreanNewsClassifier_using_torchtext: loads corpus data from BalancedNewsCorpus.zip to preprocess the data through the use of embedding so that it can go through a simple neural network, for which CNN is used. Requires the use of BalancedNewsCorpus.zip file as its data.
